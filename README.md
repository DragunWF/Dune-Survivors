# Dune Survivors 🌵

**Dune Survivors** is a top-down survival shooter developed as a final project. Pit your reflexes against relentless swarms of enemies in a hostile desert environment.

## 📖 The Story

Legends spoke of the "Gilded Dunes"—a patch of desert where gold flows like sand and ancient treasures lie exposed under the sun. Driven by the promise of fortune, you ventured into the forbidden lands, only to find the legends left out one crucial detail: the desert does not give up its treasures willingly.

Now trapped and surrounded by cursed guardians, the only way out is through. Armed with your gun and your wits, you must face the relentless horde standing between you and freedom.

## ✨ Key Features
